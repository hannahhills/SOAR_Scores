**Overview**
This PowerBI dashboard provides and overview of SOAR scores for the 2024-2025 school year at Firwood Secondary. It includes key insights and trends to help educators and administrators analyze students behavior at a glance.

**What is SOAR?**
SOAR is a method of tracking student behavior during class time. SOAR stands for Safety, Ownership, Academics, and Respect. Scores are tracked for 5 periods in a day, by either a teacher or paraeducator. Scores range from 1 (Did not meet expectation) to 3 (fully met expectation). Students may only be given a score of 0 for safety if there is damage caused by the behavior (i.e. injured student, injured staff, damaged property, etc.).
